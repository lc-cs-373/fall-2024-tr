## QUESTION 3  (CICO)

The "copy-in, copy-out" parameter passing semantics (also called
"call-by-value-result", "call-by-copy-restore", and "call-by-value-return")
combines the semantics of call-by-value with the ability to side-effect the
actual parameters if they are variables.  Specifically, if an actual parameter
is a variable and if its corresponding formal parameter is changed in the
procedure body (e.g., by a `set` expression), then the actual parameter value
should be changed to this new value, but only upon return from the procedure
call.  As in call-by-reference, any changes to formal parameters in the
procedure body that are bound to actual parameters (such as literals or other
expressions) that are not variables will have no effect on the calling
environment.  Note that if an actual parameter is a variable, any changes to
its corresponding formal parameter will *NOT* not have an effect on the actual
parameter variable *UNTIL THE PROCEDURE RETURNS*, at which point the actual
parameter will be changed to the last value that the formal parameter had.

Here's an example:

```
let
    x = 5
in
    let
        p = proc(t) { set x = add1(x) ; set t = +(t, t) }
    in
    { .p(x); x }
```

Using call-by-value semantics (SET), this evaluates to 6.  Using
call-by-reference semantics (REF), this evaluates to 12.  Using copy-in,
copy-out semantics (CICO), this evaluates to 10.

Your CICO directory has the REF implementation.  You will only be making
modifications to the `code`, `ref`, and `val` files.  The `grammar`, `prim`, and
`env` files will be unchanged.

In call-by-reference, when an actual parameter is a variable, the corresponding
formal parameter is bound to the same reference as the actual parameter, so
changes to the formal parameter have direct effects on the actual parameter
value.

To implement copy-in, copy-out, we need to de-couple the direct
reference-to-reference relationship between an actual parameter variable and a
formal parameter variable, but we need to be able to copy the formal parameter's
new value into the actual parameter's reference once the procedure returns.
We can accomplish this by creating a new kind of reference, a `VarRef`, that
will have a value part (which will be used in the copy-in part) and a reference
part (which will be used in the copy-out part).  When an actual parameter is a
variable, we will create a `VarRef` object that contains the value of the
variable and its reference, and bind the formal parameter to this `VarRef`
object.  Inside the procedure body, values of and changes to the formal
parameter (using `deRef` and `setRef`) will apply to the value part of the
reference.  When the procedure returns, we will copy out all of these values to
their corresponding actual parameter references.  For any actual parameter that
isn't a variable, we will use a normal `ValRef` object with a copy out behavior
that does nothing.

Here's a start for the code for the `VarRef` class.  You should include this in
your `ref` file, suitably named and bracketed by `%%%` lines.

```java
public class VarRef extends Ref {

    public Val val; // for copy-in
    public Ref ref; // for copy-out

    public VarRef(Ref ref) {
        this.val = ref.deRef(); // local copy
        this.ref = ref;         // where to copy out
    }

    public Val deRef() {
        return val;
    }

    public Val setRef(Val v) {
        return val = v;
    }

    public void copyOut() {
        // FIXME LATER
    }

}
```

In the `ref` file, you should add the following method to the `Ref` abstract
class:

```java
public void copyOut() {
}
```

In the `Ref` class, this (empty) definition defaults to doing nothing when it is
called.  In particular, this applies to instances of the `ValRef` derived class.

Now let's fix the `code` file so that variable actual parameters will be handled
correctly according to the copy-in, copy-out methodology.  First, observe that
the `evalRef` methods for expressions are used exclusively for passing actual
parameter expressions to their corresponding formal parameters during procedure
application.  Specifically, the default `evalRef` method in the REF language
looks like this, as defined in the `Exp` abstract class:

```java
public Ref evalRef(Env env) {
    return new ValRef(eval(env));
}
```

However, in the REF language, the `evalRef` method for a `VarExp` looks
different:

```java
public Ref evalRef(Env env) {
    return env.applyEnvRef(var);
}
```

This is exactly what makes call-by-reference work.  We need to CHANGE THIS in
the `VarExp` code for the CICO language so that it will return a suitably
instantiated `VarRef` instead.  Here is the code.  Notice that instead of
returning a reference to the variable, we return a `VarRef` object based on
that reference:

```java
public Ref evalRef(Env env) {
    return new VarRef(env.applyEnvRef(var));
}
```

You should be able to compile and run your modified language now, observing
that the result has call-by-value semantics.  (Try is using the above example
expression -- the value returned will be 6.)  So haven't we gone a bit
backwards?

What we need to fix next is the behavior of the `apply` method in the `ProcVal`
class in the `val` file.  Here the changes are straight-forward.  Currently the
last line of the `apply` method in this class appears as follows:

```java
return body.eval(nenv);
```

Instead of returning this value directly, we want to save this value, then copy
out all of the `VarRef`s to their corresponding actual parameter variables (this
is the "copy-out" part), and finally return the saved value.  Here's a start,
replacing the above `return` statement:

```java
Val val = body.eval(nenv);
// FIXME: copyOut all of the references
return val;
```

You are to replace the `FIXME` part with code that will  march through the
references in `refList` and call the `copyOut` method on each of them.  For all
of the references that ARE NOT bound to variables that are actual parameters --
these are instances of `ValRef` -- the default (do-nothing) `copyOut` method
will be called.  For the references that ARE bound to variables that are actual
parameters -- these are instances of `VarRef` -- the `copyOut` method in the
`VarRef` class will be used.

You now can compile and run your program with the above example, but you will
STILL get the value 6.  That's because you haven't actually implemented the
`copyOut` method in the `VarRef` class.  Go back to the `ref` file and make the
appropriate change to the `copyOut` method in the `VarRef` class.  It's a
one-liner: simply set the reference (saved in the `ref` instance variable) to
the value (what's in the `val` instance variable).

Your program should now properly evaluate the example expression above to 10.

## QUESTION 4

`assignments/a4/TYPE1/Programs/q4` contains the following program.

```
define compose = proc(f,g) proc(x) .f(.g(x))
define inc = proc(x) add1(x)
define sqr = proc(x) *(x,x)

..compose(inc,sqr)(5) % => 26
..compose(sqr,inc)(5) % => 36
..compose(inc,inc)(5) % => 7
..compose(sqr,sqr)(5) % => 625
..compose(sqr,.compose(inc,inc))(5) % => 49
```

`compose` takes two functions, each taking one integer argument and returning an
integer result, and returns the function (taking one integer argument and
returning an integer result) that is the composition of these two functions.

Edit `assignments/a4/TYPE1/Programs/q4` and add type annotations to the three
`define`s so that they will pass the TYPE1 language type checker.

Remember, in gitpod you can build TYPE1 as follows:

```
cd assignments/a4/TYPE1
plccmk -c grammar
```

And then you can run `q4` using `rep` as follows (assuming you are still in the
`TYPE1` directory):

```
rep Programs/q4
```

After it prints its output, you'll be at a `rep` prompt: `-->`.  Type ctrl+D or
ctrl+C to exit.

## QUESTION 5

What is the type of the following let expression?

```
let
    p = proc(f : [int => int]): [int => int] proc(x : int) : int .f(.f(x))
    q = proc(t : int) : int *(t, t)
in
    .p(q)
```

Give your answer as a type expression.

### ANSWER

Append your answer to the file `a4.txt` prefixed with `QUESTION 5`.

## QUESTION 6

What's wrong with the following expression in TYPE1?  Don't correct them. Just
identify them.

```
if add1(0) then +(4, 5) else { let p = proc() : int 9 in p }
```

### ANSWER

Append your answer to the file `a4.txt` prefixed with `QUESTION 6`.
